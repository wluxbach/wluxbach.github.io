  <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why Do People Procrastinate?</h1>
  <p> Many factors can cause people to procrastinate.</p>
  <p>Some large ones are

  <ul class="lists">
    <li>Lack of motivation</li>
    <li>Unpleasent tasks or busy work</li>
    <li>Anxiety</li>
    <li>Depression</li>
    <li>Distractions from external sources</li>
    <li>Stress</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Most of these factors point to mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and perfectionism, but also may be
    part of a bigger issue. Like ADHD.</p>
  <p>Most cases of procrastination show people have a hard time accepting projects and instead come up with reasons why they
    don't want to do it. Most of the time, they say how it won't help them in the long run, has no meaning, or that it's
    a boring project.</p>
  <p>In most cases, people procrastinate because they fear the outcome will be a negative result, like a low grade. This causes perfectionists to put it off because they are afraid of being criticized or afraid that they won't achieve the result they want.</p>
  <p>However, perfectionists put off assignments because they fear they won't be able to put the absolute best topics or ideas down as a final product. They still do the work over time, but they continue to make excuses on why they can't turn it in before or on the due date.</p>
  <p>Lastly, procrastination has long-term effects that include:
  <ul class="lists">
    <li>Sleep deprevation</li>
    <li>Irregular eating patterns</li>
    <li>Unhealthy regimens</li>
  </ul>
