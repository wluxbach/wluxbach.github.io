  <p>For the majority of people, they have to move their electronics away from their workspace to get work done. Some people work better when they sit in a quiet place away from loud noises or other people who could distract them. If you work better in a quiet place but still need some white noise, a fan or music can be an option for background sound.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, different forms of lighting can help with focus, so you might want to adjust the lights in your workspace to your liking. If you can't focus near technology, only keep what you need (like a computer, clock, or device for noise). A common strategy is to place your devices in a separate room or lock them in a drawer far away so you have to move out of your study area to get them.</p>
